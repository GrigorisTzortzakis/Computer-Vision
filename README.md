# Computer Vision & Graphics Course Exercises

This repository contains a series of hands-on exercises and solutions for the Computer Vision & Graphics course in the Department of Computer Engineering and Informatics (CEID) for the 2024–2025 academic year. The assignments cover a range of core topics—including multi-scale image representations, geometric transformations, local feature detection, image mosaicking, autoencoder architectures, and state-of-the-art object detection networks. Each exercise highlights different aspects of image processing and computer vision, challenging students to apply both classic and deep-learning-based methods.
